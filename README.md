# colonic-cancer-detection-and-classification-with-ai
Max-mark scoring project in which 100 binary image classification models were created by infusing machine learning concepts such as sigmoid/softmax activation functions, transfer learning, and more to accurately detect between Hyperplastic Polyps (typically benign) and Sessile Serrated Adenomas (typically pre-cancerous).
